# Google-Analytics
I am able to work independently, or with minimal oversight, to generate many types of Google Analytics reports and charts. Therefore, I am able to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize data, discovering patterns and trends to present both in house and client side. These reports include metrics on:
1.	Users- including measurements on demographics, number of users and sessions, new vs returning users, ratio of new to returning visitors, user acquisition and efficiency, and behavior flow 
2.	Sessions- including average session duration, average pages per session, percentage of new sessions, sessions by channel, and organic vs. paid sessions
3.	Conversions- goal conversion rate, top conversion paths, assisted conversions 
4.	Pageviews- Pageviews by Page, Average time on page, and Landing Pages
5.	Goal Overview -Goal Completions

The repository has samples of screenshots for the above reports as well as others
