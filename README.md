# Google-Analytics
I am able to work independently, or with minimal oversight, to generate many types of Google Analytics reports and charts. Therefore, I am able to prepare, process, analyze, and visualize data, discovering patterns and trends to present both in house and client side. 

The PDFs in this repo are just a few of the reports/ metrics I can easily produce independently.
